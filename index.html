        Dear Cecil <br />
        <br />
        My name is Opikhalov Dmitry, and I am interested in the Quality Assurance tester trainee position at Edenred. I have graduated for MAMK as an IT Engineer. A great deal of studies have been focused on basics of programming and algorythms, networking, OSs, cloud computing and virtualization, along with project management, business communication and MS office programs. At the moment I work at ISS Palvelut as a <span class="italy">team leader</span> of 7 employees, that come from different countries, of various age and experience level. This position requires me to <span class="bold">collaborate with the team</span>, to provide help and guidance when needed, and also to plan and to make dicisions that will benifit everyone in the team. I enjoy doing this job, but I cannot apply my professional skills there. This vacancy will allow me to combine both what I  know and what I like to do.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="italy">Relevant education</span> - B.ENG, Information
            Technology (<span class="bold">English</span>);
          </li>
          <li>
            Experience with <span class="bold">access control <span class="italy">management</span></span>;
          </li>
          <li>
            Great <span class="bold">attention to details</span> (derived from
            playing chess, troubleshooting labs and classes, then working in the high hygiene area, and now it's a way of life, actually).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I am:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Eager to learn and motivated;
          </li>
          <li>
            Morally balanced and <span class="italy">positive</span> (<span
              class="bold"
              >"every problem can be solved"</span
            >
            attitude; besides I was working for 3 years after graduation for 7
            days a week. "How's that for entertainment?"Â©);
          </li>
          <li>
            Outgoing and open-minded (travelling, team sports, theater studio).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        As an additional note, I have got clean EU
        <span class="bold">driver's licence</span> (A & B),
        <span class="bold">working permit</span> (<span class="italy"
          >unlimited</span
        >, until 07/2021), and
        <span class="bold">I live in Vantaa</span>.<br />

        <br />

        I find working principles of Geobear close to my heart, because it is quite important to be performance-driven and client-oriented. At the moment I work in a company that
        follows these policies as well, and I will be happy to continue working with like-minded people, but in a
        position that corresponds to my education and desires to develop in the field of IT. I have beem interested about sales, marketing and finance. That passion along with IT  knowledge will create a productive and efficient asmosphere. I am a fast learner, dedicated and thorough, especially with the help of hands-on experience and proper mentoring. My mind is oriented on several possible outcomes, which helps me see problems from an odd perspective.<br />
        <br />
        
        I thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and to review my resume. I am looking forward to discuss the position in person (starting from May 13), but I am available via the e-mail and I can start working as soon as possible.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Kind Regards,

        <br />
        <br />
        Opikhalov Dmitry.
