        <br />
        Dear Jonna,
        <br />
        <br />
        Please accept this cover letter as an application for the Technical Support Specialist position at Supermetrics, which is currently advertised at the LinkedIn website.
        <br />
        <br />
        My technical nature will be quite suitable for the role you are trying to fill in, because I am quite detail oriented and eager to learn how the system operates. Whilst started as a QA trainee, became a Jr. Operations Specialist half a year in and currently employed at Edenred Finland Oy as a Technical Specialist. During the trainee period I have found around 100 bugs, which helped significantly to improve the quality of the systems. As a technical specialist I support any possible production issues/data requests in a timely manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Relevant education - B.ENG, Information Technology (English);
          </li>
          <li>
            Experience in a Technical support role;
          </li>
          <li>
            Got all my working experience to be customer oriented;
          </li>
          <li>
            Been working for international companies for 6+ years;
          </li>
          <li>
            Experience in testing (mostly webapp, but the concepts are not so much different);
          </li>
          <li>
            Experience in bug reporting and documentation;
          </li>
          <li>
            ASO apartment in Vantaa.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I am:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stress tolerant and energetic (I can work under pressure);
          </li>
          <li>
            Eager to learn and motivated (understanding in details);
          </li>
          <li>
            Outgoing and open-minded (smiling most of the time);
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexible and able to prioritize.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Over my working time as a technical specialist I have learned to work with data analysis, integrations, issue investigating as well as providing the proper workaround. Moreover, I have no problems with multitasking, any challenge is considered as an opportunity to learn something new, which allows me to provide clear and reasonable explanations to the colleagues/clients and decisions that will benefit the companyâ€™s needs. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I can relate to the company's goals and visions, especially the saying "We take our work seriously - not so much ourselves", which is practically my way of living. The company itself is quite young, but the cause is solid, which unfolds the journey to be eventful and mysterious. The phrase "We are building the future of data at Supermetrics" doesn't scare me, but rather encourages me, because the fact of working in the team that creates the future's needs is the greatest opportunity for myself to bring out my best qualities in order to achieve the desired results. Hence I believe that my profile and aspirations make me a good match for a rapidly evolving and diverse company such as yourselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am looking forward to discussing the position in person. You can contact me by email or phone.<br />
        I thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and to review my resume.
        <br />
        <br />
        With Kind Regards,
        <br />
        <br />
        Opikhalov Dmitry.
